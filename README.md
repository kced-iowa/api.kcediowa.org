All documentation for this project can be found [here](https://wiki.sigourney.com).
Will potentially merge with [sigourney.com](https://github.com/horsaen/sigourney.com) for a cleaner URL, easier maintainability, whoever it is not yet at my level of knowledge, so it's gonna have to wait.

Also important to set env variables, api will not work otherwise.
